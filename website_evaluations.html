                <h3><a href="https://substack.com/">Good: Substack</a></h3>
                <p> Substack is my example for a good website, its main view on the landing page has an image as the background, with a basic tag line and clearly constrasted buttons for starting in either reading or creating on the platform.
                    Substack is a website for creating blogs or newsletters, journals, and generally sending out material published by creator based on a subscription model.

                        <ul class="crap-list">
                            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> This website uses contrast apporpriately, with a dark image at the top of the landing page, with white background below with further information. The text on the page varries according to CRAP methodology, as do the important buttons for users first accessing the website.</li>
                            <li><strong>Repetition</strong>: There is constistent color and font throughout navigating the webpages. The fonts are consistent, and is used apporpriately to denote differences in the user interface.</li>
                            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong>  The Alignment is visually connected and the simple organization of the titles and description are similar to those of papers or print articles. This choice is clear as substack is a digital version of peridicals or newsletters.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The Proximity is grouped in relevant spaces. The example articles further down the page are clearly spaced between the top of the landing page, and first visits have clear choices about what to do with the website, join/create, or see examples of work. </li>
                        </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Bad: Berkshire Hathaway</a></h3>
            <p>Berkshire Hathaway is a conglomerate holding company that owns a diverse range of businesses. 
                Berkshire Hathaway was founded by Warren Buffett, who is considered one of the greatest investors of all time. 
                The Website is very simple, with a white background and black text, and basic purple links, it appears that all of the CSS is inline. 
            </p>
            <h5 class="paragraph-header">CRAP Principles</h5>
                    <ul class="crap-list">
                        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> This website does not have apporpriate color contrast, it uses a white background and blue text, with purple colored links. The website flow is easy to follow, but it would be hard not to follow given the amount of content on the page.</li>
                        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is consistent  elements, but there are so few of them, this isn't really what should be considered a pro in this catagory</li>
                        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The Alignment is seemingly fine, although it once again accomplishes this by being extremely simple in its contruction. It is aligned in a consitent manner, but does not follow the rule of thirds, the text in the main body of the website is aligned properly. </li>
                        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The Proximity of the elements feels off, there is large holes in the body but not enough spacing betweeen the dividing lindes in the header and footer. </li>
