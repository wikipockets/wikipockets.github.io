                <p>Berkshire Hathaway is a conglomerate holding company that owns a diverse range of businesses. 
                    The company is known for its long-term investment strategy and its focus on acquiring undervalued companies. 
                    Berkshire Hathaway was founded by Warren Buffett, who is considered one of the greatest investors of all time. 
                    The Website is very simple, with a white background and black text, and basic purple links, it appears that all of the CSS is inline. 
                </p>

                            <li><b>Contrast:</b> This website does not have apporpriate color contrast, it uses a white background and blue text, with purple colored links. The website flow is easy to follow, but it would be hard not to follow given the amount of content on the page.</li>
                            <li><b>Repetition:</b>There is consistent  elements, but there are so few of them, this isn't really what should be considered a pro in this catagory</li>
                            <li><b>Alignment:</b>The Alignment is seemingly fine, although it once again accomplishes this by being extremely simple in its contruction. It is aligned in a consitent manner, but does not follow the rule of thirds, the text in the main body of the website is aligned properly. </li>
                            <li><b>Proximity:</b>The Proximity of the elements feels off, there is large holes in the body but not enough spacing betweeen the dividing lindes in the header and footer. </li>
